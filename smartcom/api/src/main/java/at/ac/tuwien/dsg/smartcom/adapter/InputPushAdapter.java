/**
 * The Input Push Adapter API can be used to implement an adapter for a
 * communication channel that uses push to get notified of new messages. The
 * concrete implementation has to use the InputPushAdapterImpl class, which
 * provides methods that support the implementation of the adapter. The external
 * tool/peer pushes the message to the adapter, which transforms the message into
 * the internal format and calls the publishMessage of the InputPushAdapterImpl
 * class. This method delegates the message to the corresponding queue and
 * subsequently to the correct component of the system. The adapter has to
 * start a handler for the push notification (e.g., a handler that uses long
 * polling) in its init method.

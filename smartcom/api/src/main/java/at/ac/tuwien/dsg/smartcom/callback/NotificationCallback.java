/**
 * The Notification Callback will be used to inform the different SmartSociety platform
 * components of the messages that arrived for them (e.g., to inform the Task Execution
 * Engine about task results or other task-related information (e.g., an error)).
 *
 * As multiple SmartSociety components may expose this API, the Middleware will try to
 * determine the exact recipient components by reading the message fields and checking
 * the routing rules. However, in some cases (e.g., asynchronous input messages from
 * peers) the Middleware may not be able to determine the exact recipient components, and
 * will forward the message to all the SmartSociety platform components implementing the
 * API. There, a requirement for those components is that they be capable of handling
 * (filtering) unexpected messages.
